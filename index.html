    <h2>Hello and welcome!</h2>
    <p>
      I am currently serving as an <b>Associate Professor</b> in the Department of Information Technology 
      at Indira Gandhi Delhi Technical University for Women (IGDTUW), New Delhi, since Jan 2024. IGDTUW is established by Govt. of NCT of Delhi in 2013.
      However, I have been serving the institution since Jan 2011 as Assistant Professor when it was known as the Indira Gandhi Institute of Technology 
      (a constituent college of GGSIP University). I have 15+ years of experience in teaching and research in academia and 3+ years of industry experience working as software developer.
    </p>
    <p>
      From July 2023 to June 2025, I worked as a <b>Postdoctoral Fellow</b> at the Institute of Data Science, 
      Department of Advanced Computing Sciences, <b>Maastricht University, Netherlands</b>.
    </p>
    <p>
      My teaching philosophy follows a <strong>"learning by doing"</strong> approach — emphasizing hands-on problem-solving 
      and practical applications to reinforce theoretical concepts. I strongly believe in problem (project) based learning.
    </p>
    <p>
      My research combines techniques from machine learning, artificial intelligence, graph algorithms, 
      and data science to address real-world problems in computational social science, (web) cyber security, 
      and the teaching-learning process.
