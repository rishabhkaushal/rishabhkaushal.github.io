      <h2>Academic Background</h2>
      
        <div class="experience">
        <h3>Postdoctoral Fellow (Department of Advanced Computing Sciences), Maastricht University, Netherlands (July 2023 - June 2025)</h3>
        <p><em><p>
  Worked as postdoc researcher with <a href="https://www.maastrichtuniversity.nl/ai-iamnitchi" target="_blank">Prof. Adriana Iamnitchi</a>, Full Professor of Computational Social Science at Maastricht University, a reputed institution, ranked under 250 in the QS World University Rankings 2025 and 132nd in the Times Higher Education Rankings 2025. 
As part of my postdoctoral work, my key contributions include:
<ul>
<li>Participated in designing and conducting empirical studies on use of generative AI in the context of online social networks, and online social media platform governance. Research studies were conceptualized, designed and executed to understand the fidelity and utility of synthetic social media data in sponsored content detection <a href="https://ojs.aaai.org/index.php/ICWSM/article/view/31303" target="_blank">ICWSM 2024</a> and multi-platform settings <a href="https://dl.acm.org/doi/abs/10.1145/3648188.3675153" target="_blank">HT 2024</a> <a href="https://arxiv.org/abs/2505.02858" target="_blank">arXiv</a>.</li>
  <li>Conducted large scale empirical analysis of transparency database maintained as per Digital Services Act which mandates social media platforms to submit moderation decisions to the European Commission, details at <a href="https://dl.acm.org/doi/10.1145/3630106.3658960" target="_blank">FAccT 2024</a>. Studied implications of Digital Services Act for researchers specifically Article 40 on data access, more details at <a href="https://arxiv.org/abs/2505.01122" target="_blank">Great Data Standoff</a> and <a href="https://cris.maastrichtuniversity.nl/ws/portalfiles/portal/263841463/090166e515c1dbca_3_.pdf" target="_blank">policy brief</a>.</li>
  <li>Work was undertaken on understanding biases in algorithmic systems and exploring frameworks for responsible and transparent AI deployment in sociotechnical environments. In particular, fairness assessment for hate speech detection in online social networks was studied in the context of Dutch language. <a href="https://aclanthology.org/anthology-files/pdf/woah/2025.woah-1.28.pdf" target="_blank">WOAH, ACL 2025</a> </li>

        <h3>Ph.D. (Computer Science), IIIT, Delhi. (2015 - 2020)</h3>
        <p><em>
  I successfully completed my Ph.D. on the topic <em>'User Identity Linkage: Data Collection, Dataset Biases, Method, Control, and Application'</em> from IIIT Delhi. I carried out my research in the 
  <a href="https://precog.iiit.ac.in/" target="_blank">Precog Research Lab</a>, under the supervision of 
  <a href="https://www.iiit.ac.in/faculty/ponnurangam-kumaraguru/" target="_blank">Prof. Ponnurangam Kumaraguru (PK)</a>, who has since moved to IIIT Hyderabad. 
  My Ph.D. thesis (<a href="https://www.slideshare.net/slideshow/user-identity-linkage-data-collection-dataset-biases-method-control-and-application/238744427" target="_blank">slides</a>, 
  <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Mg42yq2hd_c" target="_blank">video</a>) focused on the challenge of identifying user accounts belonging to the same individual across multiple social media platforms — a problem commonly referred to as <em>linked identities</em>.
  I pursued my Ph.D. as a sponsored doctoral candidate, completing it alongside my teaching and research responsibilities at IGDTUW without taking any leave or break from service.
  As part of my doctoral work, my key contributions include:
<ul>
  <li>Creating one of the largest datasets of linked user identities as ground truth (SocialCom 2019).</li>
  <li>Identifying dataset biases in collected linked identities (SAC 2020).</li>
  <li>Proposing a novel approach for node embedding to detect linked identities (NetSci-X 2020).</li>
  <li>Designing and developing a nudge to help users mitigate privacy risks arising from the linkability of their identities (SocInfo 2017).</li>
</ul>

<p>
  Beyond my core Ph.D. problem, I also worked on detecting child-unsafe (adult and violent) video content on video-sharing platforms (SAC 2019).
</p>

<p>
  With a strong interest in computational social science, I participated in the 
  <a href="https://sicss.io/2022/bologna/people" target="_blank">Summer Institute in Computational Social Science (SICSS)</a>, held at the University of Bologna, Italy, in June 2022. 
  Earlier, I attended the 3rd Summer School on Computational Social Science organized by GESIS in Berlin, Germany (2019), where our team won the Best Summer School Project Award 
  (<a href="docs/gesis.pdf" target="_blank">certificate</a>).
