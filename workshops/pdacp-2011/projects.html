<p style="margin-bottom: 0cm; text-align: justify;"><u>Flowchart Generator</u>:
Flowchart is pictorial representation of steps involved to solve a
given problem. The general approach to solve a problem is to first
write its algorithm or flowchart and then write code in a particular
programming language. However, it is generally observed that
programmers don&#8217;t follow this approach and write code directly
without writing the flowchart or algorithm. As a result, it becomes
difficult, at times, to understand the underlying problem solving
logic in their program. The project aims to develop a tool called
<i>flowchart generator </i>to generate a flowchart given a C program.

Simulations:</u> Sorting is a problem of arranging given information
in an orderly fashion either in increasing or in decreasing manner.
Information can be of any type &#8211; numerals, words in dictionary,
telephone numbers in directory, etc. There are various methods for
sorting namely insertion sort, selection sort, bubble sort, etc.
Searching is a problem of locating a particular information in a
given list of input information. There are many methods of searching
namely linear, binary and hash based searching. The goal of the
project is to <i>simulate</i> the behavior of some of these sorting
and searching algorithms <i>graphically</i> so that they could be
easily understood. Such an understanding will also help in
appreciating some of the enhancements that could be proposed for
these sorting and searching algorithms in various situations.</p>

Scheduling Simulator:</u></font> <font size="3">Modern
day operating systems provide a multi-programming environment wherein
more than on process is running in the computer. One of the functions
of the operating system therefore is to schedule the execution
sequence of these processes, in other words, decide which process be
assigned to CPU for execution when. The goal of the project is to
develop a tool called </font><font size="3"><i>CPU
Scheduler </i></font><font size="3">that
</font><font size="3"><i>simulates</i></font><font size="3">
the task of scheduling processes to the CPU through a graphical
interface. Various scheduling policies that need to be implemented
are First Cum First Serve (FCFS), Shortest Job First (SJF), Round
Robin (RR) and Priority Based (PB) scheduling.   </font></font></font>

<p style="margin-bottom: 0cm; text-align: justify;"><u>Dynamic Memory
Management Simulation: </u>Each process running on the modern day
operating systems providing a multi-programming environment needs to
be stored in main memory for it to be executed. Two schemes for
managing memory among these processes exist namely static and
dynamic. In <i>static scheme</i>, memory is divided into &#8220;fixed&#8221;
partitions which are allocated to the requesting process. This scheme
would result in wastage of memory in situation where process required
less memory than the partition, a problem referred as <i>internal
fragmentation</i>. Therefore, a <i>dynamic scheme</i> was proposed
with no partitions and memory was assigned to the processes exactly
as were required. However, in this scheme once a process would
complete, the memory de-allocated by it would create a <i>hole</i>
and as more processes would complete their execution more such holes
will start getting created, eventually a situation will arise that
although holes together can serve a requesting process but we can&#8217;t
allocate contiguous memory since these holes are scattered, a
situation which is called <i>external fragmentation.</i> To minimize
this, various strategies exist as to how to allocate memory to the
requesting process. The goal of the project is to develop a tool
called The goal of the project is to develop a tool called <i>dynamic
memory management simulator </i> that shall graphically depict the
allocation of memory as and when new requesting process arrive.
Various allocation policies that need to be implemented are First
Fit, Best Fit, Worst Fit and Next Fit.</p>

<p style="margin-bottom: 0cm; text-align: justify;"><u>Page Replacement
Simulator:</u> Paging is a very important feature of modern day
operating system. As per this approach, a process (program under
execution) is divided into fixed size blocks called <i>pages</i> and
memory is also divided into fixed size blocks of <i>same</i> size as
<i>page</i>, each memory block is called as <i>frame.</i> A page
table is maintained which contains mapping information as to which
page is allocated to which frame in memory. At some point of time,
there is no free frame available in the memory which could be given
to the requesting page and hence, some allocated page (and its
corresponding) frame is to be picked up (referred as <i>page fault</i>)
and allocated to the requesting page. Various strategies are possible
as to which page is to be selected as victim namely First In First
Out (FIFO), Optimal Page Replacement (OPR), Most Recently Used (MRU)
and Least Recently Used (LRU).

Simulations:</u> Data structures are one the fundamental building
blocks which are used for organization of data for solving problems
in an efficient manner. The goal of the project is to <i>simulate</i>
the various operations (insertion, deletion, update, etc) on
conventional data structures namely arrays, linked lists, stacks,
queues, trees and graphs.</p>

<p style="margin-bottom: 0cm; text-align: justify;"><u>Memory Map Simulator:</u>
As a program is run and its instructions begin executing, the memory
spaces get reserved for storing information (local variables, arrays,
pointers, structures, etc.). Both static and dynamic memory
allocation and de-allocation needs to be considered. The goal of the
project is to depict graphically the changes that happen in the
memory as the program is getting executed. In order words, all
allocations and de-allocations of memory are to be displayed as the
program is run.</p>
