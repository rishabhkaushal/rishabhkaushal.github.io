<div style="text-align: justify;">Department of Information Technology
envisages as one of its goals to orient students towards solving
challenging real world problems by leveraging the practical CS/IT
skills learnt during their 4-Year B.Tech.(CS/IT) programmes. To realize
this, the Academic Schemes have been designed such that students imbibe
real world problem solving orientation by incorporating academic and/or
industrial training during their Summer Break after the completion of
Second[1] and Third[2] Year of their B.Tech.(CS/IT) programmes,
respectively. However, despite this, it is often observed by
prospective recruiters from the industry during placement drives that
students lack practical problem solving skills. Consequently, students
selected in core CS/IT companies (like Microsoft, Google, Yahoo,
Amazon, etc. which offer a very high compensation pay packages and
carries out product development and research which is intellectually
stimulating) are far less than those selected in service based CS/IT
companies (like TCS, Infosys, etc)[3]. This trend is disappointing
because it neither resonates with the capabilities nor with the
aspirations of the highly talented and meritorious cream of students
who deservedly secure admission at one of the better known colleges at
the town, IGIT.&nbsp; <br>
</div>
<br>
<div style="text-align: justify;">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; After considerable
deliberations and brain storming, it is observed that one of the
reasons for such a situation is lack of focus on CS/IT skills (courses)
in the First Year. There is only one CS/IT course namely Introduction
to Computers in First Semester and Introduction to Programming in
Second Semester during the First Year. Students are unable to
appreciate the importance of these single CS/IT courses amidst 5-6
Non-CS/IT courses which are science (non-engineering) and
non-mainstream based courses during First Year. The fact that there is
no mandatory training during Summer Break at the end of First Year
further alienates a student from these much needed skills at an early
stage in their B.Tech.(CS/IT) programmes.<br>
</div>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; <br>
<div style="text-align: justify;">Therefore, Department of Information
Technology plans to organize first of its kind, a Training cum Workshop
on &#8220;Project Development using Advanced C Programming&#8221; during the Summer
Vacations for the interested students. The aim would be to bring back
focus on CS/IT skills and draw student&#8217;s attention towards their
primary goal as prospective software engineers i.e. to leverage CS/IT
skills to solve real world problems.<br>
