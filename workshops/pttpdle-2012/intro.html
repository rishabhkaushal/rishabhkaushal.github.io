</p>
<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Acquiring
an ability to solve challenging problems through programming based
solutions is one of the indispensable skills for a student in the field
of Computer Science (CS), Information Technology (IT) and Computer
Applications (CA). Programming based solutions requires a familiarity
of various tools and techniques, besides the rigorous and sustained
practice of programming. The Workshop proposed herewith is a humble
effort envisaged in inculcating these skills early among students of
CSE/IT/CA disciplines so that they are aptly equipped for project
development.&nbsp; <br>

<div style="text-align: justify;"><span style="font-weight: bold; text-decoration: underline;">Introduction:</span><br>
<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; &nbsp;&nbsp; In view of above, this Workshop is planned in concurrence with the 
principles of an earlier successful Workshop (details <a href="../pdacp-2011/index.html" target="_blank">here</a>) titled <b>Programming Tools and 
Techniques for Project Development in Linux Environment</b> to be held in June-July, 2012.<br>

<br>
The salient features of the Workshop are as under:-
<p>
<b> * </b>Introducing the programming using open source software in a
Linux environment, thereby emphasizing the use of open source tools and
platforms.
</p><p>
<b> * </b>Inculcating a programming rigor among students which is
essential in understanding most of the CS/IT subjects (offered in
subsequent semesters) through <span style="font-style: italic;">learning by doing</span> approach.
</p><p>
<b> * </b>Most of the lectures would be undertaken by highly talented
and experienced faculty members with a proven track record with both
academic and industry experience.
</p><p>
<b> * </b>Most of the topics covered in the Workshop shall be beyond those taught in regular curriculum.
